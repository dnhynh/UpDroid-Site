							<h3>Your Agreement with Updroid, Inc.</h3>
							<p>1.1	Your use of the Updroid service is governed by this agreement (the “Terms”). “Updroid” means Updroid, Inc., located in San Francisco, CA, United States, and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved in providing the Services. The “Services” means the services Updroid makes available through this website, including this website, the Updroid [development terminal] and any other software or services offered by Updroid in connection to any of those.</p>
							<p>1.2  In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You can agree to the Terms by actually using the Services. You understand and agree that Updroid will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.</p>
							<p>1.3 You may not use the Services if you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Services are not intended for children under 13.</p>
							<p>1.4 You agree your purchases of Services are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Updroid or any of its affiliates regarding future functionality or features.</p>
							<h3>2. Your Account and Use of the Services</h3>
							<p>2.1 You must provide accurate and complete registration information any time you register to use the Services. You are responsible for the security of your passwords and for any use of your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify Updroid immediately.</p>
							<p>2.2 Your use of the Services must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances, including any laws regarding the export of data or software.</p>
							<p>2.3 You agree not to engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service).</p>
							<p>2.5 You may use the Services only to develop and run programs on the Updroid platform. You may not access the Services for the purpose of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against Updroid or for the purpose of creating a product or service competitive with the Services.</p>
							<h3>3. Service Policies and Privacy</h3>
							<p>3.1 You agree to comply with the Updroid Acceptable Use Policy [hyperlink] (the “Acceptable Use Policy”) which is incorporated herein by this reference and which may be updated from time to time. [Note: Decide if you think you need an acceptable use policy – this is from Terminal.com - <a href="https://www.terminal.com/acceptable" target="_blank">https://www.terminal.com/acceptable</a>]</p>
							<p>3.2 The Services shall be subject to the privacy policy for the Services available at [privacy policy – hyperlink]. You agree to the use of your data in accordance with Updroid’s privacy policies.</p>
							<p>3.3 You agree that you will protect the privacy and legal rights of the End Users of any application you develop on the Updroid platform. You must provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for End Users. If End Users provide you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the users aware that the information will be available to your application and to Updroid. [Note, if you don’t think there will be any end users you can delete]</p>
							<h3>4. Fees for Use of the Services</h3>
							<p>4.1 Except as set forth elsewhere on the Updroid website, the Services is provided to you without charge.</p>
							<p>4.2 For all purchased resources and services, we will charge your credit card on a monthly basis or at the interval indicated in Updroid fees and payment policies, if different. Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). Charges are exclusive of taxes. You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys fees Updroid incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Updroid’s measurements of your use of the Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Updroid and only in the form of credit for the Services. Nothing in these Terms obligates Updroid to extend credit to any party. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Updroid may be shared by Updroid with companies who work on Updroid’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Updroid and servicing your account. Updroid may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Updroid shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. Updroid reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the Services to you for any late payments.</p>
							<p>4.3 Updroid may change its fees and payment policies for the Services by notifying you at least fifteen (15) days before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect. Changes to the fees or payment policies will be posted on the website (or such other URL Updroid may provide from time to time). Any outstanding balance becomes immediately due and payable upon termination of the Terms for any reason.</p>
							<h3>5. Content on the Services and Take Down Obligations</h3>
							<p>5.1 You understand that certain information on the Updroid website to which you may have access as part of, or through your use of, the Services may have been created by other users of the Services and are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content originated. All such information is referred to below as the “Content.” </p>
							<p>5.2 Updroid reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to remove any or all Content from the Services.</p>
							<p>5.3 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Updroid has no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any Content that you create, transmit or display while using the Services and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which Updroid may suffer) by doing so.</p>
							<p>5.4 You agree that Updroid has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any Content and other communications maintained or transmitted through use of the Service. You further acknowledge that you are solely responsible for securing and backing up your Applications and any Content.</p>
							<h3>6. Proprietary Rights</h3>
							<p>6.1 You acknowledge and agree that Updroid (or Updroid's licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Services (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).</p>
							<h3>7. License from Updroid and Restrictions</h3>
							<p>7.1 Updroid gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Updroid as part of the Services as provided to you by Updroid. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Updroid, in the manner permitted by the Terms.</p>
							<p>7.2 You may not (and you may not permit anyone else to): (a) copy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the Services or any part thereof, unless this is expressly permitted or required by law, or unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by Updroid, in writing (e.g., through an open source software license); or (b) attempt to disable or circumvent any security mechanisms used by the Services or any applications running on the Services.</p>
							<p>7.3 Open source software licenses for components of the Services released under an open source license constitute separate written agreements. To the limited extent that the open source software licenses expressly supersede these Terms, the open source licenses govern your agreement with Updroid for the use of the components of the Services released under an open source license.</p>
							<p>7.4 Updroid hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable license, with no right to sub-license, to display the Updroid trademarks and/or logos as provided here (“Marks”) for the sole purpose of promoting or advertising that you use the Services and solely in accordance with Updroid’s then current Trademark Usage Guidelines, which may be found at trademark (or such other URL Updroid may provide from time to time). You agree that all goodwill generated through your use of the Updroid Marks shall inure to the benefit of Updroid.</p>
							<h3>8.License from You</h3>
							<p>8.1 You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about the Services, including without limitation about how to improve the Services or our products (“Ideas”). By submitting any Idea, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place Updroid under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we are free to use the Idea without any additional compensation to you, and/or to disclose the Idea on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone.</p>
							<p>8.2 You agree that Updroid, in its sole discretion, may use your trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names and other distinctive brand features in presentations, marketing materials, customer lists, financial reports and Web site listings (including links to your website) for the purpose of advertising or publicizing your use of the Services.</p>
							<h3>9. Modification and Termination of the Services</h3>
							<p>9.1 Updroid is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which Updroid provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you, subject to the terms in Section 4.3. Changes to the form and nature of the Services will be effective with respect to all versions of the Services; examples of changes to the form and nature of the Services include without limitation changes to fee and payment policies, security patches, added functionality, and other enhancements.</p>
							<p>9.2 You may terminate these Terms at any time by canceling your account on the Services. You will not receive any refunds if you cancel your account.</p>
							<p>9.3 You agree that Updroid, in its sole discretion and for any or no reason, may terminate your account or any part thereof. You agree that any termination of your access to the Services may be without prior notice, and you agree that Updroid will not be liable to you or any third party for such termination.</p>
							<p>9.4 You are solely responsible for exporting your Content from the Services prior to termination of your account for any reason, provided that if we terminate your account, we will provide you a reasonable opportunity to retrieve your Content.</p>
							<p>9.5 Upon any termination of the Services or your account these Terms will also terminate, but Sections 6.1, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 15 shall continue to be effective after these Terms are terminated.</p>
							<h3>10. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES</h3>
							<p>10.1 NOTHING IN THESE TERMS, INCLUDING SECTIONS 10 AND 11, SHALL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT UPDROID’S WARRANTY OR LIABILITY FOR LOSSES WHICH MAY NOT BE LAWFULLY EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
							<p>10.2 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE UPDROID SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.”</p>
							<p>10.3 UPDROID, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS MAKE NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SREVICES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, UPDROID, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT TO YOU THAT: (A) YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR (B) YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR FREE FROM ERROR.</p>
							<h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
							<p>11.1 SUBJECT TO SECTION 10.1 ABOVE, YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT UPDROID, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES WHICH MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU, HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY. THIS SHALL INCLUDE, BUT NOT BE LIMITED TO, ANY LOSS OF PROFIT (WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY), ANY LOSS OF GOODWILL OR BUSINESS REPUTATION, ANY LOSS OF DATA SUFFERED, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS.</p>
							<p>11.2 THE LIMITATIONS ON UPDROID’S LIABILITY TO YOU IN PARAGRAPH 11.1 ABOVE SHALL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT UPDROID HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.</p>
							<h3>12.Indemnification</h3>
							<p>12.1 You agree to hold harmless and indemnify Updroid, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners (collectively “Updroid and Partners”) from and against any third party claim arising from or in any way related to (a) your breach of the Terms, (b) your use of the Services, (c) your violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with the Services, or (d) your Content, including any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages (actual and consequential), suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees, of every kind and nature. In such a case, Updroid will provide you with written notice of such claim, suit or action.</p>
							<h3>13.Other Content</h3>

							<h3>14.Changes to the Terms</h3>
							<p>14.1 Updroid may make changes to the Terms from time to time. If we change the Terms in any substantive way, we will give you at least seven (7) days notice before the changes take effect, during which period of time you may reject the changes by terminating your account.</p>
							<p>14.2 You understand and agree that if you use the Services after the date on which the Terms have changed, Updroid will treat your use as acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
							<h3>15. General Legal Terms</h3>
							<p>15.1 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Updroid and govern your use of the Services (but excluding any services which Updroid may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Updroid in relation to the Services.</p>
							<p>15.2 There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms. The parties are independent contractors, and nothing in these Terms creates an agency, partnership or joint venture.</p>
							<p>15.3 If Updroid provides you with a translation of the English language version of these Terms, the English language version of these Terms will control if there is any conflict.</p>
							<p>15.4 You agree that Updroid may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Services. By providing Updroid your email address, you consent to our using the email address to send you any notices required by law in lieu of communication by postal mail.</p>
							<p>15.5 You agree that if Updroid does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Updroid has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Updroid’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Updroid.</p>
							<p>15.6 Updroid shall not be liable for failing or delaying performance of its obligations resulting from any condition beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, governmental action, acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood or other acts of God, labor conditions, power failures, and Internet disturbances.</p>
							<p>15.7 The Terms, and your relationship with Updroid under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

							<p>15.8 Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations under these Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign the entirety of its rights and obligations under these Terms, without consent of the other party, to its affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets not involving a direct competitor of the other party. A party’s sole remedy for any purported assignment by the other party in breach of this paragraph shall be, at the non-assigning party’s election, termination of your use of the Services upon written notice to the assigning party.</p>

							<p>Terms of Service last updated on December 14, 2015</p>
						</div>
						<div class="tab-content">
							<p>Protecting your privacy is important to us. With this in mind, we are providing this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive through our Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service. So, please make sure that you have read and understand our Terms of Service. This Privacy Policy also applies to information collected from individuals who make purchases from us via any website where this Privacy Policy is posted and consequently any references to “Services” in this Privacy Policy include our services in connection with such purchases.</p>
							<h3>Revisions to this Privacy Policy</h3> 
							<p>Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we’ll update the “Last Updated Date” above to indicate when those changes will become effective.</p>
							<h3>Collection and Use of Information</h3>
							<br><br>
							<h3>Information Collected or Received from You </h3>
							<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.</p>
							<p><span class="underline">Personal Information</span>. We will collect certain information that can be used to identify you (“PII”), in connection with your use of the Services. This PII may include: (i) your name, (ii) mailing address, (iii) telephone number, (iv) email address, and, (v) for those purchasing Products, credit card, billing and delivery information. If you create a Updroid account (“Account”), we may also collect certain PII to populate your Account. If you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your social networking site (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc) accounts (“SNS Accounts”), we will be able to access and collect your name and email address and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. If you create an Account through the Site or one of your SNS Accounts, we may also collect your gender, date of birth and other information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.</p>
							<p><span class="underline">Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies</span>. Like many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.</p>
							<p>“<span class="bold">Cookies</span>” are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web server when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.</p>
							<p>“<span class="bold">Web Beacons</span>” (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).</p>
							<p><span class="underline">Information Related to Use of the Services</span>. Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “<span class="bold">Log Data</span>”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “<span class="bold">User</span>”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.</p>
							<p><span class="underline">Information Sent by Your Mobile Device</span>. We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.</p>
							<p><span class="underline">Location Information</span>. When you use our Services we may collect and store information about your location by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location or by accessing your mobile device’s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device.</p>
							<h3>Information that We Share with Third Parties</h3>
							<p>We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below:</p>
							<p><span class="underline">Information Shared with Our Services Providers</span>. We may engage third-party services providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your PII for any other purpose.</p>
							<p><span class="underline">Information Shared with Third Parties</span>. We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.</p>
							<p><span class="underline">Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions</span>. Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your PII, may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.</p>
							<p><span class="underline">Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others</span>. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>
							<h3>Your Choices</h3>
							<p>We offer you choices regarding the collection, use and sharing of your PII and we’ll respect the choices you make. Please note that if you decide not to provide us with the PII that we request, you may not be able to access all of the features of the Services.</p>
							<p><span class="underline">Opt-Out</span>. We may periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote our Services or Products. When you receive such promotional communications from us, you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” (either through your Account or by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive). We do need to send you certain communications regarding the Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications – e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy or information about billing.</p>
							<p><span class="underline">Modifying Your Information</span>. You can access and modify the PII associated with your Account by contacting us at <a>support@Updroid.com</a>. If you want us to delete your PII and your Account, please contact us at <a>support@Updroid.com</a> with your request. We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon we can, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.</p>
							<h3>Responding to Do Not Track Signals </h3>
							<p>Our Site does not have the capability to respond to “Do Not Track” signals received from various web browsers. </p>
							<h3>The Security of Your Information</h3>
							<p>We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information on our forms, we encrypt this data using SSL encryption or other technologies. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.</p>

							<p>You understand that all scheduled shipment dates and Estimated Shipment Dates are estimates only. We will make reasonable efforts to meet the scheduled shipment dates, but in no event will we be liable for any loss, damage, or penalty resulting from any delay in shipment or delivery, nor will the carrier be deemed our agent. If you purchase multiple Products, we may send you your Products in installments and charge you separately for each installment. We have the right to allocate our available inventory of the Products among other purchasers in such manner as we see fit. If we are not able to charge your payment method or you fail to pay for your purchase, we have the right to delay or suspend shipment of the Products.</p>
							<h3>Prices and Taxes </h3>
							<p>The prices for the Products will be as specified during checkout and in your Order Confirmation.

							<p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Updroid, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected to your violation of these Terms and your participation in Disclaimed Activities, or for liabilities, interest, penalties or fees assessed against us arising from any failure by you to pay any required taxes.</p>
							<h3>Limitations of Liability </h3>
							<p>SUBJECT TO ANY WARRANTY PROGRAM WE MAY OFFER, THE PRODUCT IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS AND YOUR USE OF THE PRODUCT IS AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND IN NO EVENT WILL UPDROID BE LIABLE FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF REVENUE, USE, PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL) OR COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE PURCHASE, SALE, USE, OPERATION OR PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCTS, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER OR NOT UPDROID HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. YOU AND UPDROID HAVE AGREED THAT THESE LIMITATIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THESE TERMS IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL UPDROID’S LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS, FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY, EXCEED THE ACTUAL AMOUNT PAID TO UPDROID BY YOU FOR THE PRODUCT THAT GIVES RISE TO THE CLAIM. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.</p>
							<h3>Software License </h3>
							<p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Updroid grants you a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable license to use the software in the Product (the “<span class="bold">Software</span>”), as part of your use of the Product for your own personal, non-commercial purposes and for no other purposes.

To the extent that the Products are being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government then, as provided in FAR 12.212 and DFARS 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the U.S. Government’s rights in the software and any related documentation will be only those specified in these Terms.</p>
							<h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
							<p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p>
							<p><span class="underline">Agreement to Arbitrate</span> For any dispute with Updroid, you agree to first contact us at <a>legal@Updroid.com</a> and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Updroid has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after thirty (30) days, you and Updroid agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Product (collectively, “<span class="bold">Disputes</span>”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “<span class="bold">IP Protection Action</span>”); and (iii) you retain the right to litigate any Dispute other than an IP Protection Action by providing Updroid with written notice of your desire to do so by email or regular mail at our contact information at the bottom of these Terms within thirty (30) days following the date you first accept these Terms (such notice, an “<span class="bold">Arbitration Opt-out Notice</span>”). If you do not provide Updroid with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide Updroid with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide Updroid with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, <span class="bold">you acknowledge and agree that you and Updroid are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding</span>. Further, unless both you and Updroid otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
							<p><span class="underline">Arbitration Rules</span> The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<span class="bold">AAA</span>”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “<span class='bold'>AAA Rules</span>”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med">www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879). The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p>
							<p><span class="underline">Arbitration Process</span> A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820" target="_blank">http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820</a> and a separate form for California residents at <a href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822" target="_blank">http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822</a>). The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
							<p><span class="underline">Arbitration Location and Procedure</span> Unless you and Updroid otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Updroid submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
							<p><span class="underline">Arbitrator’s Decision</span> The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Updroid will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
							<p><span class="underline">Fees</span> Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Updroid will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
							<p><span class="underline">Changes</span> If Updroid changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date on which you placed your order for a Product, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to legal@Updroid.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Updroid’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Updroid in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>
							<h3>General Terms </h3>
							<p>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Updroid and you regarding the purchase of the Product, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Updroid and you regarding such a purchase. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
							<p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Updroid’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Updroid may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
							<p>Any notices or other communications provided by Updroid under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the www.Updroid.com. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>
							<p>Updroid’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Updroid. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p>

        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h3>General:</h3>
        <p class="question">
        Q. What is UP1?</p>
        <p>A. UP1 is a robotics platform for software development. It has hardware configured for manipulation, mobility, and sensing. It also has a software framework for developing applications that can make use of the hardware. <span class="bold">In other words, it’s a programmable robot</span>.</p>

        <p class="question">Q. What can I do with UP1?</p>
        <p>A. Out of the box, it comes with an app for <span class="bold">remote control</span> over a network. The app allows you to see through its cameras and control driving or the arm with a keyboard, game console controller (e.g. Xbox or PS3), or mobile device. Of course, the remote control app is like any other <span class="bold">apps that you can write yourself</span> (we will provide documentation on this).</p>

        <p class="question">Q. It sounds like a computer, what’s that about?</p>
        <p>A. UP1 has an Intel Atom processor at its core - a full embedded computer. It runs a Debian-based Linux OS that you have full access to. SSH, bash, nodejs, ROS… all that good stuff! We designed it this way to maximize the potential of creative users integrating robotics software with the usual services and libraries associated with regular PC-based development.</p>

        <p class="question">Q. What are some things the UP1 can do that are not depicted in the video?</p>
        <p>A. In terms of autonomous behavior, that is limited only to what you can think up and what the UP1 itself is physically capable of.  On our end, we will post up new ideas and applications on our blog as we develop them.  You can keep up to date with our blog by following our twitter feed or joining our mailing list.</p>

        <h3>Development:</h3>
        <p class="question">Q. I have experience with ROS and don’t feel like I need the UpCom IDE. Is it the only way I can use UP1?</p>
        <p>A. Definitely not. We designed the UP1 software architecture to follow the conventions established on other popular ROS platforms and you can expect it to work in a familiar way. See our publicly available UP1 packages at https://www.github.com/updroidinc for more details and documentation.</p>
        
        <p class="question">Q. Is the software for UP1 open-source?</p>
        <p>A. For the most part. The firmware on the motor controllers is proprietary, as is the core of UpDroid Commander - the things that probably wouldn’t satisfy anything but pure curiosity. The meat of the robotics software contained in ROS packages is all open-source. The UpCom SDK and example plugins are all open-source as well. You can find all our open-source software at <a href="https://www.github.com/updroidinc" target="_blank">https://www.github.com/updroidinc</a>. For more details, please see the various licenses that accompany our software.</p>

        <p class="question">Q. Is UP1’s hardware open-source?</p>
        <p>A. We don’t want to upset anyone by misusing the term “open-source hardware”, so we won’t go that far. That said, the interfaces for third party and custom modules are thoroughly detailed and released under the (TAPR Open Hardware License?). These interfaces include dimensional outlines for the mating surfaces between module enclosures and pinout descriptions for the power/signal connectors.</p>
        <h3>Launch:</h3>
        <p class="question">Q. Is UP1’s battery removable?</p>
        <p>A. Yes, it is removable and user-replaceable. We will provide replacement batteries through our store.</p>

        <p class="question">Q. Will UP1 be able to do everything as depicted your videos by the time it ships?</p>
        <p>A. It is certainly capable of completing the actions that are shown. However, they may only be interpreted as end use-cases for the purpose of stimulating the imagination. As UP1 is not only a recreational gadget, but a development platform as well, it will be up to the user to develop these into fully autonomous behaviors. That’s the real fun part :)</p>

        <p class="question">Q. Are cloud services involved in any core UP1 functionality?</p>
        <p>A. UP1 was designed to be a standalone device at the bare minimum, requiring only one other device (e.g. PC, mobile) on a local network to access it over Wi-Fi. Remote-controlling UP1 or programming it  requires no Internet connection. However, as with most other devices - you will be able to download software updates and expand its library of applications by connecting it to the Internet.</p>

        <p class="question">Q. Will other modules be available at launch?</p>
       <p> A. No, but they are currently in development and will be released periodically post-launch.</p>

        <p class="question">Q. What is the cancellation policy for pre-ordering UP1?</p>
        <p>A. You will be refunded for the full amount that we charged you at original checkout as long as you cancel your order before we notify you that your UP1 has shipped, should you choose to do so.</p>

        <h3>Misc:</h3>
        <p class="question">Q. What are the warranties and details for defective product and maintenance?  Return policy?</p>
        <p>A. These details are currently TBA, but they will be in line with similar technology products. We expect to have these details well before UP1 starts shipping.</p>
