    # Change Log
    
    ## 0.5.3 - 2015-7-31
    
    ### Changed
    - An alert is now displayed in the browser to give the user instructions on how to set up package build logging with the `cmdr buildlog` command.
    
    ### Fixed
    - Fixed invalid Markdown in the Changelog.
    - Fixed Editor issues with the unsaved changes indicator (asterisk on the filename) not properly indicating the current state of the document.
    - Fixed serious bug where building a package in Explorer would crash cmdr if permissions weren't properly set on the build output log at `/var/log/updroid/build.log`.
    
    ## 0.5.2 - 2015-7-30
    
    ### New
    - Camera tabs now display the current video device on tab handle hover.
    - Added individual package cleaning via right-clicking on packages within the Explorer Workspace view.
    - Package build output is now appended to a file at `/var/log/updroid/build.log`. cmdr will attempt to create this file if the directory permissions allow it to.
    - Added a new top-level command to cmdr (see cmdr --help). Intended to be run within a Console tab to view package build output.
    
    ### Changed
    - Explorer now automatically loads solo workspaces detected in `~/uproot`.
    - Internal installation path structure has changed (in `/opt/updroid/cmdr`).
    - The cmdr executable is now installed within `/opt/updroid/cmdr` with a symlink dropped into `/usr/bin`.
    - Console's "dark" theme is now a little darker.
    - Explorer's "build" buttons have been renamed "verify".
    - Explorer's verify button will now build the entire workspace by default if no packages are selected.
    - Improved cmdr crash handling, where the GUI page can be refreshed after dimissing a disconnect alert and restarting cmdr.
    
    ### Fixed
    - Console should now properly resize automatically once the frontend and backend are both loaded.
    - Fixed Explorer issue with building the top-level 
    - Fixed Explorer issues with building ROS metapackages.
    - Fixed a bug where closing a Camera tab would occasionally crash cmdr.
    
    ## 0.5.1 - 2015-7-16
    
    ### New
    - Tab columns can now be "maximized" (where other Tab columns become hidden).
    - Tabs can now be "cloned" (in terms of type) and moved between columns via a right-click menu from their handles.
    
    ### Changed
    - Changed the icon for Launchers view button in the lower-right corner of Explorer.
    - Small aesthetic improvements.

        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h3>General:</h3>
        <p class="question">
        Q. What is UP1?</p>
        <p>A. UP1 is a robotics platform for software development. It has hardware configured for manipulation, mobility, and sensing. It also has a software framework for developing applications that can make use of the hardware. <span class="bold">In other words, it’s a programmable robot</span>.</p>

        <p class="question">Q. What can I do with UP1?</p>
        <p>A. Out of the box, it comes with an app for <span class="bold">remote control</span> over a network. The app allows you to see through its cameras and control driving or the arm with a keyboard, game console controller (e.g. Xbox or PS3), or mobile device. Of course, the remote control app is like any other <span class="bold">apps that you can write yourself</span> (we will provide documentation on this).</p>

        <p class="question">Q. It sounds like a computer, what’s that about?</p>
        <p>A. UP1 has an Intel Atom processor at its core - a full embedded computer. It runs a Debian-based Linux OS that you have full access to. SSH, bash, nodejs, ROS… all that good stuff! We designed it this way to maximize the potential of creative users integrating robotics software with the usual services and libraries associated with regular PC-based development.</p>

        <p class="question">Q. What are some things the UP1 can do that are not depicted in the video?</p>
        <p>A. In terms of autonomous behavior, that is limited only to what you can think up and what the UP1 itself is physically capable of.  On our end, we will post up new ideas and applications on our blog as we develop them.  You can keep up to date with our blog by following our twitter feed or joining our mailing list.</p>

        <h3>Development:</h3>
        <p class="question">Q. I have experience with ROS and don’t feel like I need the UpCom IDE. Is it the only way I can use UP1?</p>
        <p>A. Definitely not. We designed the UP1 software architecture to follow the conventions established on other popular ROS platforms and you can expect it to work in a familiar way. See our publicly available UP1 packages at https://www.github.com/updroidinc for more details and documentation.</p>
        
        <p class="question">Q. Is the software for UP1 open-source?</p>
        <p>A. For the most part. The firmware on the motor controllers is proprietary, as is the core of UpDroid Commander - the things that probably wouldn’t satisfy anything but pure curiosity. The meat of the robotics software contained in ROS packages is all open-source. The UpCom SDK and example plugins are all open-source as well. You can find all our open-source software at <a href="https://www.github.com/updroidinc" target="_blank">https://www.github.com/updroidinc</a>. For more details, please see the various licenses that accompany our software.</p>

        <p class="question">Q. Is UP1’s hardware open-source?</p>
        <p>A. We don’t want to upset anyone by misusing the term “open-source hardware”, so we won’t go that far. That said, the interfaces for third party and custom modules are thoroughly detailed and released under the (TAPR Open Hardware License?). These interfaces include dimensional outlines for the mating surfaces between module enclosures and pinout descriptions for the power/signal connectors.</p>
        <h3>Launch:</h3>
        <p class="question">Q. Is UP1’s battery removable?</p>
        <p>A. Yes, it is removable and user-replaceable. We will provide replacement batteries through our store.</p>

        <p class="question">Q. Will UP1 be able to do everything as depicted your videos by the time it ships?</p>
        <p>A. It is certainly capable of completing the actions that are shown. However, they may only be interpreted as end use-cases for the purpose of stimulating the imagination. As UP1 is not only a recreational gadget, but a development platform as well, it will be up to the user to develop these into fully autonomous behaviors. That’s the real fun part :)</p>

        <p class="question">Q. Are cloud services involved in any core UP1 functionality?</p>
        <p>A. UP1 was designed to be a standalone device at the bare minimum, requiring only one other device (e.g. PC, mobile) on a local network to access it over Wi-Fi. Remote-controlling UP1 or programming it  requires no Internet connection. However, as with most other devices - you will be able to download software updates and expand its library of applications by connecting it to the Internet.</p>

        <p class="question">Q. Will other modules be available at launch?</p>
       <p> A. No, but they are currently in development and will be released periodically post-launch.</p>

        <p class="question">Q. What is the cancellation policy for pre-ordering UP1?</p>
        <p>A. You will be refunded for the full amount that we charged you at original checkout as long as you cancel your order before we notify you that your UP1 has shipped, should you choose to do so.</p>

        <h3>Misc:</h3>
        <p class="question">Q. What are the warranties and details for defective product and maintenance?  Return policy?</p>
        <p>A. These details are currently TBA, but they will be in line with similar technology products. We expect to have these details well before UP1 starts shipping.</p>
