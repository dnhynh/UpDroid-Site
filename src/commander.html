                    <p>UpDroid Commander (UpCom) is a browser-based IDE for robotics software development. It can be installed on an Ubuntu <span class='version'>14.04 x86_64</span> PC that is connected to robotics hardware (sensors, actuators) alongside ROS (Robot Operating System).  You can install ROS <a href='http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu'>here</a>.</p><br>
                    <p>UpCom is on version <span class='version'>0.4.4</span>. It was tested on Google Chrome version <span class='version'>42.0.2311.90</span> and Chromium <span class='version'>42.0.2311.90</span>.  As UpCom is currently in its Alpha phase, please expect issues and help make us aware of them through its feedback button.  <span class='version'>Happy Programming</span>.</div>

                        <p><span class='switch'>UpDroid Commander (</span>UpCom<span class='switch'>) is a browser based IDE for robotics software development. It</span> features a multi-tabbed interface with several built-in tabs for robotics software development. Soon you will be able to add user created tabs as well. The built-in tabs currently available are: Editor, Console, and Camera-feed viewer. Additionally, UpCom features a file explorer to easily view your development workspace with drag-and-drop file management.<span class='switch'>  Download our alpha and start programming today!</span></p>

                            <p>By default, UpCom will watch a folder called UpRoot which is created on its first launch unless you specify another workspace path. The explorer will show the file system which can be manipulated from within the browser. You can also quickly open files by dragging and dropping files into the editor.</p>

                            <p>The UpCom console is a projection of your own terminal window into the browser. Having a console integrated into the UpCom IDE means less switching between windows during development.</p>

                            <p>Helpful control buttons allow you to clean and build your workspace with a single click. Another lets you run ROS launch files and nodes through a simple menu. A share button currently integrated with Git can automatically commit your unstaged package changes and push them to the preconfigured remote repository.</p>
