                            <p>Building a robot is hard. Trust us, it's just hard, we've been working on it for a while. Programming a robot is fun but building it, well it often involves a lot of swearing.</p>

                            <p>Whether you write your own robotics application, or download a package from a selection of pre built behaviors, what you do with the UP1 is up to you.</p>

                                        <p>It sees, it hears, it speaks.  The I/O snaps on top of the base and gives the UP1 the senses it needs to perceive the world around it.  It's core components are two front facing cameras, a speaker, and a microphone for voice detection.</p>
